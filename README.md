Analysis of Airline Reviews Scraped from SkyTrax Website

## Project Overview
The purpose behind this project is to see from the data scraped from SkyTrax, which features of a flight are most significant in deciding a patron's overall experience and whether they would or would not recommend that experience to other travellers.  Air travel has changed over time along with the amenities available on flights or the size of seats, it is important for airline companies to understand the perspective of their clients in order to audit they're own performance as well as gaining insights in what services to invest in to gain market share over competitors. The site [SkyTrax](https://skytraxratings.com/about) was chosen as it is a one stop shop for international reviews of airlines offering reviews a wide range of services going back decades.
